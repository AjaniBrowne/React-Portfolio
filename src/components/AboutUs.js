      <p>
       Welcome welcome to my unique app. My name is Ajani Browne. I did not start out as a software developer, but I embarked on a journey to become one.
       I went to the University of Central Florida and received my Bachelor's Degree in Sports and Exercise Science. 
       After 9 years of being a personal trainer I decided it was time to start a career instead of staying at a job.
       I joined the UCF coding bootcamp to begin this transition. I started with Javascript but I have a long list of languages to learn.
       I will learn as soon as possible. I look forward to working with an amazing team to create new applications.
       Happy coding.
